			<p> Edge To Node graphs by Geoffrey (No input enabled yet) </p>
			<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
			
			<div id="explanation">
				<p> A graph can be thought of as a modeling for some existing entities all having relationships of some kind. The entities can be modelled by nodes and their relationships can be modelled by edges. </p>
				<p> An "Edge To Node" graph is a graph generated by converting all of the edges in a previous graph to nodes, and then placing edges between the new nodes who were adjacent edges in the previous graph. More abstractly these graphs model relationships as entities.</p>
				<p> This applet generates said graphs by placing a node at the midpoint of all edges in the given graph and then connecting the correct nodes. </p>
				<p> Some interesting observations about such graphs are: 
					<ul>
					<li>Some graphs lose nodes, some stay constant, and some gain nodes between generations.</li>
					<li>A complete graph with more than 3 nodes seems to begin a sequence of iterations who's nodes are 2^n+1 times the previous iteration in number.</li>
					<li>Some graphs reduce in size, some stay constant, and some increase in size between iterations.</li>
					<li>If a_0 is a subgraph of b_0, then the graph a_k seems to be a subgraph of the graph b_k where a_k, and b_k are the respective graphs generated after k iterations of the algorithm. This of course doesn't happen when the graph reduces in size as with line graphs and some trees.</li>
					<li>Graphs which are minimal cycles will not change between iterations (will be isomorphic).</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
