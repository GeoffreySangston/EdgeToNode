			<p> Edge To Node graphs by Geoffrey (No input enabled yet) </p>

			<div id="explanation">
				<p> A graph can be thought of as a modeling for some existing entities which all have relationships of some kind. The entities can be modelled by nodes and their relationships can be modelled by edges. </p>
				<p> An "Edge To Node" graph is a graph generated by converting all of the edges in a previous graph to nodes, and then placing edges between the new nodes who were adjacent edges in the previous graph. More abstractly these graphs model relationships as entities. For example a group of people's friendships may be modelled as a graph where the people are the nodes and the friendships are the edges (an edge connects two friends). The friendships themselves may then have relationships between themselves and that graph would be the edge to node graph of the friendship graph. Another example may be that a scandalous lad dates three girls concurrently. This graph may be viewed as a tree with the lad at the root and the girls as leaves. These three relationships may then have relationships between each other. This new graph is the edge to node graph of the original love tree and is the complete graph with three nodes (triangle).</p>
				<p> This applet generates said graphs by placing a node at the midpoint of all edges in the given graph and then connecting the correct nodes. </p>
				<p> Some interesting observations about such graphs are: 
					<ul>
					<li>Some graphs lose nodes, some stay constant, and some gain nodes between generations.</li>
					<li>The number of edges in the ETN graph coming from the graph A seems to be the sum of (deg)(deg-1)/2 for each node in A. The is because all edges which meet at a single node form a complete graph in the ETN graph with the same number of edges as the degree of the single node. The number of edges in a complete graph with n nodes is (n)(n-1)/2. (Not a rigorous proof).</li>
					<li>The ETN graphs of regular graphs are regular.</li>
					<li>If a_0 is a subgraph of b_0, then the graph a_k seems to be a subgraph of the graph b_k where a_k, and b_k are the respective graphs generated after k iterations of the algorithm. This of course doesn't happen when the graph reduces in size as with line graphs and some trees.</li>
					<li>Graphs which are minimal cycles will not change between iterations (will be isomorphic).</li>
					<li>Ideas of relationships between integers to play with: divisibility, common factors, coprime, gcd, lcm, modulo congruence, etc... Other ideas: biregular graphs, huffman codes</li>
					</ul>
